# TODO App for MoroSystems

This repository is a single-page application built with React, Redux/Redux Saga, and TypeScript. It leverages Styled
Components and Sass as a preprocessor for styling. Additionally, it adopts a separate SCSS file structure and employs
hooks for pre-commit tasks. The codebase is maintained using ESLint and Prettier to ensure proper code structure and
syntax.

While some technologies, like React Router, may not be strictly necessary, they have been integrated to provide a
comprehensive showcase of capabilities.
